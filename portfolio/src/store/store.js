                During Project 3, the game was developed with the combined efforts of 20 people, divided in Coding, Design and Art departments. Additionally, a marketing campaign was deployed, through social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/malitathegame">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/malitagame/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKmG8wNjSxjrQ8kdyABiuA">YouTube</a>) and massive email sending.

                This project showcases my ability as a game designer and creative mind in general, since the project expands on the original material, with more characters and multiple endings. On top of that, it was my first time using RPG maker, so it is also quite acomplished technically. 

                Finally, the memory generated for the game is a proof of my competence generating documentation. I believe that it is really important to do this for all projects, otherwise, important information tends to be forgotten and then it is harder to iterate down the line.`,
