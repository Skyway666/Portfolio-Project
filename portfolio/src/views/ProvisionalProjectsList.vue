          The game was developed using the Atlas-Project engine, wich used the <a href="https://skyway666.github.io/Kuroko-Engine/"> Kuroko Engine </a> as a base, but was expanded and improved with the results of all the other students that participated in the "Engines" subject, adding the subsystems of Animation, UI, Sound, Shaders, Particles and Physics.

          During Project 3, the game was developed with the combined efforts of 20 people, divided in Coding, Design and Art departments. Additionally, a marketing campaign was deployed, through social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/malitathegame">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/malitagame/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKmG8wNjSxjrQ8kdyABiuA">YouTube</a>) and massive email sending.

It was awarded with the price to the <a href ="https://www.citm.upc.edu/blog/1a-edicion-enero-2019/">best Design</a>, and later published to itch.io.
          
          The game is about an imprisoned Nun who is attacked by the guards and has to deffend herself using a crucifix and a holy ball. However, the guards can't be hit directly with the crucifix,  so the player needs to direct the holy ball, which is then capable of hurting the enemies. 

          The game does resemble the game jam's theme due to wordplay, since "Sor Presa" in spanish means "Prisoner Nun".`,

          This project showcases my ability as a game designer and creative mind in general, since the project expands on the original material, with more characters and multiple endings. On top of that, it was my first time using RPG maker, so it is also quite acomplished technically. 

          Finally, the memory generated for the game is a proof of my competence generating documentation. I believe that it is really important to do this for all projects, otherwise, important information tends to be forgotten and then it is harder to iterate down the line.`,
