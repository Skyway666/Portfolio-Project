It was build in Unity and developed by 4 people in 24 hours, 2 artists and 2 coders, while we all participated in the design. It was awarded with the price to the <a href =\"https://www.citm.upc.edu/blog/1a-edicion-enero-2019/\">best Design</a>, and later published to itch.io.\n\nThe game is about an imprisoned Nun who is attacked by the guards and has to deffend herself using a crucifix and a holy ball. However, the guards can't be hit directly with the crucifix,  so the player needs to direct the holy ball, which is then capable of hurting the enemies. \n\nThe game does resemble the game jam's theme due to wordplay, since \"Sor Presa\" in spanish means \"Prisoner Nun\".",

On top of that, it was my first time using RPG maker, so it is also quite acomplished technically.\n\nFinally, the memory generated for the game is a proof of my competence generating documentation. I believe that it is really important to do this for all projects, otherwise, important information tends to be forgotten and then it is harder to iterate down the line.",
